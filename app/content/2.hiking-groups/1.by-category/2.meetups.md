## Meetups

### Facebook Meetup Groups

These Facebook groups are useful to find hiking/scrambling, and even climbing partners:

- [Alberta Hikers Together](/hiking-groups/group-info/alberta-hikers-together): Dedicated to finding hiking/scrambling partners.
- [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](/hiking-groups/group-info/find-hiking-groups-partners-alberta): Dedicated to finding hiking/scrambling partners.
- [Alberta Hikers & Climbers](/hiking-groups/group-info/alberta-hikers-and-climbers): Not dedicated to finding hiking/scrambling partners, but the community is tight-knit and people use the group to coordinate activities.


Difference between [Alberta Hikers Together](/hiking-groups/group-info/alberta-hikers-together) and:
- [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](/hiking-groups/group-info/find-hiking-groups-partners-alberta): 
  - The two groups have very similar goals and rules. 
  - Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta has more members and is a bit more active.
  - Alberta Hikers Together is a public group, so when cross posting in different groups, it's easier to post first in Alberta Hikers Together, and then share to the other groups.
- [Alberta Hikers & Climbers](/hiking-groups/group-info/alberta-hikers-and-climbers): 
  - Alberta Hikers & Climbers caters to those with an intermediate to advanced skill level in either hiking or climbing.
  - The Alberta Hikers & Climbers community is more tight-knit, and not just focused on finding hiking partners. People ask and post about trail conditions, avalanche and crevasse rescue courses, 
    scrambling routes, indoor climbing events, etc.
  - Alberta Hikers & Climbers is a place where you interact with people first (share tips, ask information, etc) to build connections, and then find hiking/scrambling/climbing partners as a result of the interaction.
  
### Meetup.com Groups

I am not familiar with these [meetup.com groups](https://www.meetup.com/), but they are pretty popular, so definitely worth mentioning. 
If anyone is willing to add a bit more background information about each group, it would be welcome.

- [Slow and Steady Hikers](https://www.meetup.com/slow-and-steady-hikers/): Even though advertised as "slow and steady", the actual speed depends on each organizer. Each organizer vets the participants and
  in some cases, even have a waitlist.
- [Calgary Nature and Social Adventures](https://www.meetup.com/calgary-nature-and-social-adventures/)
- [Calgary/Banff Hiking, X-C Skiing, and Snowshoeing](https://www.meetup.com/calgarybanffhikingmeetup/)
