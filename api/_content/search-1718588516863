You do all the necessary research to determine whether you are comfortable and experienced enough to attempt the hike/scramble.\nPlease point to me anything that looks fishy with my plan, as I'm no expert, I could be pushing for something that doesn't make sense.  You decide what equipment, gear, maps, and amount of food & water you need to bring in order to tackle the hike/scramble.  If you have doubts or questions, reach out to me and we will sort it out.

Start on time : To be respectful of everyone who shows up on time, we start the hike at the time that is advertised.\nKeep in mind that the meeting time is always 15 minutes before the start. So if you are 5 minutes late, you are not 5 minutes late,\nyou are 20 minutes late.   Lots of pictures along the way : When the weather / conditions are right, I take a lot of pictures.\nIf you hate picture breaks, you are\nmore likely to enjoy my company when the weather is cold and I restrict them to a minimum.\nIf you do love picture breaks, make sure to wear flashy colors so we can have good shots!\nI always share my pictures in full quality/resolution after the hike.   Moderate/intermediate pace : Unless stated otherwise, I aim to go at a moderate pace for most of my hikes. The hard part about this point is that\neveryone seems to have a different definition of \"moderate pace\", so it is a bit hard to accurately describe.\nMy version of \"moderate\" pace has a tendency to turn into a \"fast\" pace on the \"boring\" sections (approach roads without views, etc), and into a slow pace because of pictures\nwhen the views are amazing and the sun welcomes us.   Long break at the top : When the weather is good, I love spending   several hours  at the summit. It's not everyone's thing, so it makes it even more important to mention.\nIf you don't like long breaks, I have two options for you:\n   I don't insist on the group staying together the whole time, so it is perfectly fine if part of the group splits to complete the hike.  Join the early/late season hikes when the temperature is colder. I don't insist on long breaks when it's freezing outside.   Finish the hike at a reasonable time : I usually camp on Saturday nights, and hike the next day. So I'm usually trying to complete the hike by 5pm, to give a little time\nfor a cold dip and a beer with the team. I don't mind finishing a bit later on Sundays, as I'm not trying to beat the traffic, but rather let it go and get back home after the rush.","titles":[]},"21":{"title":"Your Safety, Your Responsibility","content":"Please note that I am not a professional guide.\nI have average mountain and navigation skills and you assume all responsibility for your safety and well-being and preparedness.\nDo your own research to ensure that you know what you are getting into and be prepared to be self-reliant in case we have to split.More specifically:Don't take for granted that I know what I am doing. I have some ideas/plans, but these may not be realistic/possible under the current conditions, or at all.  Do your own research to get your own feel of the adventure  Make sure you have all the maps and directions that you need.  Plan the adventure like if the group will need to split.  Make sure to bring enough food and water. Don't forget that on nice, sunny days, we will take extended breaks, so you will consume more water than usual.  Depending on the conditions, make sure to bring the gear you need (helmet, spikes/crampons, ice axe, etc). Do not hesitate to ask the rest of the group what gear they are considering bringing.  Things don't necessarily go according to plan. Bringing a headlight and warmer clothes is never a bad idea.  TODO: link to a nice checklist, someone must have already compiled one online","titles":["What to expect on Sami's hikes"]},"22":{"title":"Staying all together vs splitting the group","content":"One of the subjects that seems to create division is whether the group has to stay together all the time, or if it is fine to split the group.My take is that philosophically, I'm perfectly fine with splitting. Especially with bigger groups (7-9), it often happens that\ndifferent people end up adopting a different pace, and that things are simply more harmonious if we let the group split rather than artifically\nkeep it together. Live, and let live! Whatever moments shared together are good moments that don't need to last for the entire hike.\nSharing part of the hike is better than not sharing the hike at all.Also part of the debate is if someone overestimated their ability to complete a hike/scramble safely, is it fair to ask the whole group to turn back?\nIn this particular case, my personal take is unless the person's life is in danger, we should try to find practical arrangements for the\nperson to either turn back or wait for the group. Things can get tricker if the hike is a loop, though.However, in practice, some things have to be considered:If the hike has a restriction on the minimum number of people in the group (e.g. Parks Canada bear safety), then splitting a smaller group may not be an option  Out and back vs loop. If going out and back, it is less stressful to leave some people behind and wait for them at the summit as the group is necessarily coming back anyways.\nBut what about loops? How confident are we that the people behind can safely complete the loop or turn back?  Maps and directions: Everyone in the group is   expected  to have all the maps and directions. But are we sure that the people we leave behind indeed do have all the information?  Technicality of the hike/scramble vs experience of the team: is the hike comparable to a \"walk in the park\", or is it a more intense scramble?  Are there lots of other people on the trail?  Car pooling arrangements are also something to consider when splitting the group.If anyone joining my hikes feels strongly about staying together all the time, it is best to discuss it before the hike to align the expectations. Otherwise, we will just try to use common sense depending\non the situation to ensure that we don't split the group in a dumb way if a natural split happens.","titles":["What to expect on Sami's hikes"]},"23":{"title":"Frequently Asked Questions","content":"","titles":["What to expect on Sami's hikes"]},"24":{"title":"Why are your hikes starting so early?","content":"Different people are willing to make different compromises to enjoy their hiking days.In my case, the priority goes to:Taking my time during the hike with plenty of picture breaks.  Enjoying extended breaks at the summit (several hours during the core of the summer).  Finishing early (~5pm) to enjoy a beer and a cold dip with the rest of the team, and have enough time to eat and go to bed early to be ready for the next hike.  Having extra room for when things don't go exactly according to plan.As a result, I simply start the hike early-enough to be able to achieve all that.To give realistic examples of what early starts mean for longer day hikes,We started   Pharaoh Peak  at 4am and caught the sunrise on Healy Pass around 7am (August 2022)  We started the   Skyline Trail  at 5am (September 2023).And for what it's worth, I advertised both of these hikes as \"FAST\" hikes, not \"moderate pace\" ones.","titles":["What to expect on Sami's hikes","Frequently Asked Questions"]},"25":{"title":"Why don't you wait for people who are late?","content":"When I create an event, I set the meeting time 15 minutes before we actually start the hike, to give people enough time to put their boots on, go to the washrooms, adjust their gear, etc.So, when someone doesn't show up by the time we start the hike, we have technically already waited for 15 minutes:Isn't 15 minutes a fair time to wait for late people?  If not, what is a fair amount of time to wait for?Factors motivating this system:Consistent/easy to grasp rules regardless of the availaibilty of cellular network at the trailhead to receive messages about people behind late or not coming.  Fairness to people who show up on time. Especially with early starts when the temperature is often cold even during the summer.  Without cellular connectivity, it isn't even possible to know whether people will join or whether they cancelled.","titles":["What to expect on Sami's hikes","Frequently Asked Questions"]},"26":{"title":"What groups do you advertise your hikes on?","content":"I first create an event on   Alberta Hikers Together  (public group, so events can be seen by anyone), and then share it to:Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta  (private group)   Alberta Hikers & Climbers  (private group)","titles":["What to expect on Sami's hikes","Frequently Asked Questions"]},"27":{"title":"Why don't you vet people who join your hikes like most other organizers do?","content":"I don't see myself as a full-fledged \"organizer\". I just go hiking, and I am happy to share (part of) the trail with others.\nSame idea as when going hiking with friends, except that some participants are not friends (yet).  I suspect that the meetup organizers who have a vetting process in place spend a non-negligeable amount of time on that, which I would like to avoid for as long as possible.  So far, I'm running at a pace of roughly one potentially-avoidable incident worth mentionning per summer (May-Nov), and so far, these incidents have not been catastrophic.\nIs it worth spending days vetting people to avoid these rare and minor incidents? Would my vetting process be so good that I would avoid these incidents anyways?  Some of the incidents were arguably partly my fault where I set the wrong expectations. So I hope that by being more mindful about setting expectations, it would solve part of the problem.  Even if I wanted to vet people, how good would I be at that? I recently moved to Alberta, and don't have that much experience with the mountains.  Honestly, most of the people I have hiked/scrambled with are more experienced and do better research than me anyways. So I would feel a bit of an imposter.","titles":["What to expect on Sami's hikes","Frequently Asked
